# birthday_wisher
A python project that automatically detects whether it's someone's birthday or not based on datetime and it sends them a one of three happy birthday letters (randomly picked) with their name on it. 
I scheduled this code to run daily to check if it's any of my friends' birthday using pythonanywhere cloud service
